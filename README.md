# Small Challenges
## What is this repository?
I've built this repository as an excuse to have fun with code and as a way to share small bits of learning with the world. You will find various *Small Challenges* in the folders at the root of this repository. All of these will eventually be accompanied by a solution. At this very moment, I am not sure how I will share the solutions but we'll get there eventually.

## Challenges organisation
All files are numbered and all files have a *category*. Right now only two categories exist:
* FigureOutTheCode - This is meant to be a challenge where you need to figure out what the code does, or something similar to that;
* FindTheVulnerabilities - This is meant to be a challenge where you need to find one or more vulnerabilities in the code.
